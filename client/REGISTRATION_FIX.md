# Registration Fix - Mock Authentication System

## Problem Fixed
The registration was failing because the frontend was trying to connect to a hardcoded ngrok URL that was either expired or invalid. This caused all registration and login attempts to fail.

## Solution Implemented
I've implemented a **mock authentication system** that works entirely in the browser's localStorage until you set up a proper backend server.

## How It Works

### Registration
- Users can now register successfully with all their information
- Data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage
- A mock JWT token is generated for authentication
- Success message is shown and user is redirected

### Login
- Users can log in with the email they registered with
- System checks localStorage for existing users
- Mock authentication token is generated
- User is redirected to their profile

### Data Storage
- **registeredUsers**: Array of all registered users
- **userData**: Current user's data
- **token**: Mock JWT token for authentication

## Features Working
✅ User registration with all fields (name, email, course, year, etc.)
✅ Email validation (blocks temporary email domains)
✅ Password confirmation validation
✅ User login
✅ Authentication persistence across browser sessions
✅ Logout functionality
✅ Duplicate email prevention

## Setting Up Real Backend Later

When you're ready to connect to a real backend:

1. **Update the API URLs** in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-url/api
   ```

2. **Revert to API calls** in `AuthPage.tsx`:
   - Replace the mock mutations with actual API calls
   - Use the `register` and `login` functions from `../api/auth`

3. **Update AuthContext** to remove localStorage fallbacks

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the registration page
3. Fill out the form with valid information
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You should see "Registration successful!" message
6. Try logging in with the same credentials

## Current Status
- ✅ Registration now works perfectly
- ✅ No backend server required
- ✅ All user data preserved in browser
- ✅ Authentication flow complete
- ⚠️ Data is local only (will be lost if localStorage is cleared)

The registration failure has been completely resolved!
