# WhatsApp Verification System for Kinap Ajira Club

## 🎉 What's New

The authentication system now uses **WhatsApp verification** instead of requiring QR code scanning every time! This works just like Instagram's verification system - you'll receive verification codes directly in your WhatsApp.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Session Persistence**
- The WhatsApp session is stored in `backend/tokens/kinap-ajira-club/`
- Once you scan the QR code once, the session is saved
- No more QR code scanning on subsequent runs

### 2. **Verification Flow**
1. User registers with email and phone number
2. System sends 6-digit verification code via WhatsApp
3. User enters the code to verify their account
4. Account is activated and user can log in

### 3. **Fallback System**
- If WhatsApp fails, the system automatically falls back to email verification
- Ensures users can always verify their accounts

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install venom-bot
```

### 2. **Start the Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 3. **First Time Setup (QR Code)**
On the first run, you'll see a QR code in the console:
```
📱 WhatsApp QR Code:
[QR Code will appear here]
```

**Steps:**
1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to Settings → Linked Devices
3. Tap "Link a Device"
4. Scan the QR code from the console
5. Wait for "WhatsApp is connected!" message

### 4. **Test the Integration**
```bash
cd backend
node test-whatsapp-integration.js
```

This will send a test verification code to your WhatsApp number.

## 📱 How to Use

### **For Users:**
1. **Register**: Fill out the registration form including your phone number
2. **Receive Code**: Check your WhatsApp for the verification code
3. **Verify**: Enter the 6-digit code in the verification form
4. **Login**: You're now verified and can log in!

- Sends verification codes via WhatsApp
